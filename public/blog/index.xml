      <description>In my time as a student, an IT professional as well as a teaching assistant, I often came across a very small yet important concept of project management - a stand-up meeting. While I enjoyed having it, I observed that most of the students as well as IT professionals working in the industry find it either a waste of time or think of it as a redundant act of a typical meeting with just one difference - standing up.</description>

      <description>As the competition increases in the global economy with unstable environments, many organisations have implemented IT solutions in the last three decades to make their organisation more effective and efficient. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) being one of the most popular of them. Growing use of ERP and its strategic importance has always sparked the interest of researchers.

      <description>Did you know that colours play a very important role in the way a living being perceives information? Colours are not just a topic in fine-arts but they are a science in itself. Don’t worry, I am not going to get into the physics of a prism converting the white light into rainbow colours. But if you are interested in it, please read https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/refrn/Lesson-4/Dispersion-of-Light-by-Prisms in your spare time. It is really interesting.</description>

      <description>I have observed that many software applicatoins struggle with designing interfaces, cracking the user experience, and building mock-ups. There is often a dilemma between making something complex and making something beautiful. Yes, I said ‘beautiful’ and not ‘simple’. Something complex in the back-end doesn’t mean it has to be confusing in the front-end. I have come across many applications that are packed with amazing functionalities and very well-thought back-end code design but simply lack a good interface.</description>
