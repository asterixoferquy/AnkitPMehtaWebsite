          <article class="post__content">
              
<p>In my time as a student, an IT professional as well as a teaching assistant, I often came across a very small yet important concept of project management - a stand-up meeting. While I enjoyed having it, I observed that most of the students as well as IT professionals working in the industry find it either a waste of time or think of it as a redundant act of a typical meeting with just one difference - standing up. Through this article, I try to break these misconceptions. I also noticed that even if they knew what a stand-up meeting is, they never practised it correctly. Maybe it is because there is not a single correct way of doing things when it comes to project management but we can always understand and practise the ‘most correct way’.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with understanding what exactly a stand-up meeting is. A major point here, we will be understanding this concept in terms of a typical ‘software development’ environment. One of the most widely trusted sources in the world - Wikipedia (sarcasm intended) defines stand-up as ‘a meeting in which attendees typically participate while standing. The discomfort of standing for long periods is intended to keep the meetings short.’ This is a very generic definition. When it comes to a software development environment, I define it simply as “a short and regularly held meeting in which all attendees stand up and update each other on what they did since the last stand-up meeting, what they are currently working on, what they intend to accomplish till the next stand-up meeting and if anything is blocking their workflow”. It’s as simple as that. It is not complicated at all.</p>
<h2 id="importance-of-stand-ups">Importance of Stand-ups<a class="anchor" href="#importance-of-stand-ups">#</a></h2>
<p>Although their are small in size but they have a big impact on the overall project management. Here are a few reasons they are so important:
As a member of a software development team, imagine yourself chasing almost every team member to know the status of their task since your work depends on it. First of all, you will need to figure out who is doing what. Once you know that, contacting that person for a while just to a quick update.
Members might be unaware of their dependencies or the risks to their tasks till they hear someone else highlighting their respective tasks. Things can skip form our mind from time to time as nobody is perfect.
The team leader comes to know exactly how much more time is required and what tasks, if necessary, need to be shifted to the next iteration. All this, in a very short period of time.
Regularly conducting this meeting enables all team members to be on the same page.
External dependencies of tasks can be highlighted and addressed early and appropriate actions can be done before it explodes into a risk or poor product delivery.
Each team member gets to see and talk to other team members when they attend this meeting. There are less chances of conflicts due to regular communication.
Based on the amount of time each member is taking to complete each task, a correction in the effort and resource estimation can be done at an early stage.
Attendees can quickly ask for help from other teammates if they are stuck somewhere in their task. This will provide the team leader with an idea as to how much buffer time needs to be allocated to the helping member.</p>
<h2 id="the-stand-up">The Stand-up<a class="anchor" href="#the-stand-up">#</a></h2>
<p>Stand-up meetings are usually done in an Agile work/project environment. Let’s break this definition to understand how it’s done.</p>
<h3 id="a-short--">“A short -”<a class="anchor" href="#a-short--">#</a></h3>
<p>A stand-up meeting has to be short. If you are wondering how long should a stand-up meeting last, my suggestion would be to multiply the number of attendees by 2 minutes and add 2 minutes to the total. For example, if there are 5 members attending the stand-up, the ideal time should be 12 to 13 minutes. The reason why I suggest to add two minutes in the end is for the team leader to summarise and conclude the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="regularly-held-meeting--">“regularly held meeting -”<a class="anchor" href="#regularly-held-meeting--">#</a></h3>
<p>This meeting should be held regularly. A common practice in the industry is daily. If you don’t meet this often then make sure that you have it at least thrice a week. If in an academic environment all team members are not present, conduct this meeting virtually over tools such as Skype or Google Hangout, but you must make sure everyone stands up even on a video conference call. Regularly conducting this meeting will help you estimate the work which needs to be done and the time that needs to be invested more accurately. It will help the team keep their work and deliverables balanced and organised.</p>
<h3 id="in-which-all-attendees-stand-up--">“in which all attendees stand up -”<a class="anchor" href="#in-which-all-attendees-stand-up--">#</a></h3>
<p>The intention of making everyone stand-up is to make sure that no one speaks more than required and that the meeting doesn’t go on for a long time. Remember, in a work environment, time is money and in an academic environment, time is precious since you can use the extra time for playing or finishing other assignments.</p>
<h3 id="and-update-each-other-on-what-they-did-since-the-last-stand-up-meeting--">“and update each other on what they did since the last stand-up meeting -”<a class="anchor" href="#and-update-each-other-on-what-they-did-since-the-last-stand-up-meeting--">#</a></h3>
<p>Each attendee has to give an update about what they did since the last stand-up meeting and not provide a detailed explanation on what they have been working on since the beginning of the project. Remember, every member has up to only 2 minutes each to speak.</p>
<h3 id="what-they-are-currently-working-on--">“what they are currently working on -”<a class="anchor" href="#what-they-are-currently-working-on--">#</a></h3>
<p>Each attendee needs to speak about what they are working on at the moment. For example, if you have picked up a Trello card a moment ago or have run your code to compile, mention that. Just mention and do not try to explain everything. Other types of meetings can be arranged specially for that.</p>
<h3 id="what-they-intend-to-accomplish-till-the-next-stand-up-meeting--">“what they intend to accomplish till the next stand-up meeting -”<a class="anchor" href="#what-they-intend-to-accomplish-till-the-next-stand-up-meeting--">#</a></h3>
<p>Once each member has given an update about what they have completed since the last stand-up and what they are working on at the moment, it’s time to speak about what they intend to achieve till the next stand-up. Do not explain on how you plan to achieve it or what your end goals for the whole project are.</p>
<h3 id="and-if-anything-is-blocking-their-workflow">“and if anything is blocking their workflow.”<a class="anchor" href="#and-if-anything-is-blocking-their-workflow">#</a></h3>
<p>While giving a brief about what they are working on right now and what their next action is, each attendee must also mention if something or someone else’s is block them to do their work. This is quiet common in a team project environment. Usually when user stories and product features are inter-dependent, there are high chances that one member&rsquo;s work needs some of other member’s tasks to finish before he can continue working. There can also be things which are not under the team’s control for example a situation where the client needs to respond to your important request but he is on a vacation at a remote location where there is no access to the internet or cellular network. This is the perfect time to mention that. The team leader must quickly make notes of these dependencies and maintain a temporary list of them. A detailed discussion regarding that should be held outside the stand-up meeting between the team leader and the members involved in the dependency.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-end">In the end<a class="anchor" href="#in-the-end">#</a></h2>
<p>The team leader now has two minutes to quickly summarise what the current status of the project is, how are the tasks looking and if any improvements are required. That’s it! The end! The meeting is successfully over! Not the team leader must call the members whose tasks are facing some delays due to inter-dependency or an external factor. This can be a detailed, “normal”, “sit-down” meeting.</p>
<h2 id="some-important-rules">Some important rules<a class="anchor" href="#some-important-rules">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The sequence of members speaking must be in one direction. It can be clockwise or anti-clockwise.</li>
<li>All members must be standing till the meeting is over. You should not sit down as soon as your turn is over.</li>
<li>Only one person should speak at a time.</li>
<li>This meeting is not meant for internal conflict resolution. So no such issues must be raised during this meeting.</li>
<li>Members should update their Trello tasks before coming to the meeting. They can then refer to it during the meeting.</li>
<li>All topics which might take a while to discuss must be taken outside of the meeting and not discussed at that moment.</li>
<li>The meeting must be held regularly. If some member is unable to attend it, they must update their Trello tasks and inform the team leader about it prior to the meeting.</li>
</ul>
