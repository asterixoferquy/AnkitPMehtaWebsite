      <description>Did you know that colours play a very important role in the way a living being perceives information? Colours are not just a topic in fine-arts but they are a science in itself. Don’t worry, I am not going to get into the physics of a prism converting the white light into rainbow colours. But if you are interested in it, please read https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/refrn/Lesson-4/Dispersion-of-Light-by-Prisms in your spare time. It is really interesting.</description>

      <description>I have observed that many software applicatoins struggle with designing interfaces, cracking the user experience, and building mock-ups. There is often a dilemma between making something complex and making something beautiful. Yes, I said ‘beautiful’ and not ‘simple’. Something complex in the back-end doesn’t mean it has to be confusing in the front-end. I have come across many applications that are packed with amazing functionalities and very well-thought back-end code design but simply lack a good interface.</description>
