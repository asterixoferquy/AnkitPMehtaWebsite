I’m an IT professional, blogger, and a productivity enthusiast who is passionate about helping organisations grow to their true potential, while contributing to the society by spreading knowledge and asking the right questions.

My history-focused blog [The History Nerd](https://thehistorynerd.com/) explores the past of everyday things, proverbs, events, and everything under the sun. It tries to answer the questions which one may have never asked. For example, who’s [feet](https://thehistorynerd.com/a-brief-history-of-the-measurement-feet/) are we talking about while measuring in feet? How did the [‘Biryani’](https://thehistorynerd.com/the-historic-adventures-of-biryani/) travel all the way from Iran to south Asia and now is an integral part of the Indian cuisine?
