As the competition increases in the global economy with unstable environments, many organisations have implemented IT solutions in the last three decades to make their organisation more effective and efficient. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) being one of the most popular of them. Growing use of ERP and its strategic importance has always sparked the interest of researchers. This report attempts to introduce an ERP system and various implementation methods and later an analysis of major organizational issues and success factors.
The report argues that companies which aggressively expand into new markets and look for new opportunities (often known as prospectors) make the best use of ERP systems compared to those which do not take many risks and are just concerned about keeping a strong grip on their current market (often known as defenders).
There have been four widely used ERP implementation mechanisms which have been covered in this report. Every implementation methodology greatly influences the outcomes of the ERP development and every mechanism has its own blessing and flaw. Though the definition of success and failure of a system depends on the perspective of the stakeholder, this report tries to cover the most widely experienced issues and success factors amongst large, medium and small-sized enterprises. Fifteen success factors were recognized in taking into consideration experiences from various organizations and research conducted by IT practitioners and accomplished authors in this field of expertise.
